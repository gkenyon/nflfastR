ROC Curve example
False Positive Rate == (1 - Specificity) on X
True Positive Rate (Sensitivity) on Y
AUC = Area Under the Curve (higher = better)

1) Split the data

split_data <- initial_split(data, 0.75)
train_data <- training(split_data)
test_data <- testing(split_data)

Good data hygeine is obviously important.

rsample
Now that I've created the dataset to use, I'll start with tidymodels proper.

rsample at a mininum does your train/test split, but also takes care of things like boostrapping, stratification, v-fold cross validation, validation splits, rolling origin, etc.

Data Splitting w/ rsample
Do the initial split and stratify by play type to make sure there are equal ratios of run vs pass in test and train


tidyverse, do reshaping and basic cleaning.
